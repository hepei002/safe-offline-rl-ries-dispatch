Simulated hourly country-aggregated heat demand and COP time series

This dataset comprises national time series for representing building heat
pumps in power system models. The heat demand of buildings and the
coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pumps is calculated for 28
European countries from 2008 to 2022 in an hourly resolution.
Heat demand time series for space and water heating are computed by
combining gas standard load profiles with spatial temperature and wind
speed reanalysis data as well as population geodata. The profiles are
year-wise scaled to 1 TWh each. For the years 2008 to 2015, the data is
additionally scaled with annual statistics on the final energy consumption
for heating.
COP time series for different heat sources – air, ground, and groundwater
– and different heat sinks – floor heating, radiators, and water
heating – are calculated based on COP and heating curves using reanalysis
temperature data, spatially aggregated with respect to the heat demand, and
corrected based on field measurements.
All data processing as well as the download of relevant input data is
conducted in python and pandas and has been documented in the Jupyter
notebooks linked below. Please also consider and cite our <a
